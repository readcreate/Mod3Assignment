// Instructions: Create an application that accepts two integers within two separate prompts. Then, display only the larger of the two within the browser window. Donâ€™t forget to handle the fact that the two could be equal.

let int1 = parseInt(prompt('Enter your first integer'))
let int2 = parseInt(prompt('Enter your second integer'))
let biggerNumber

if (int1>int2) {
    document.write(`${int1} is the larger number you entered, rounded to the nearest lower whole number.`)
} else if (int2>int1) {
    document.write(`${int2} is the larger number you entered, rounded to the nearest lower whole number.`)
} else if (int1 === int2) {
    document.write(`The two numbers you entered are both ${int1}, so neither is larger, when rounded to the nearest lower whole number.`)
} else {
    document.write('An error has occurred. Perhaps you didn\'t enter numbers?')
